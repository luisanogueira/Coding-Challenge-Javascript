# Coding-Challenge-Javascript

# Technologies used and time allotted
For this project I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. 
I needed aproximatelly 6 hours to finish everything, using part of this time to plan how I wanted the application to look and what it should do, and for research.

# How to run the application
This application has two input fields, one to select a specific starting date to book a Hotel, and another one to select how many days the user would like to reserve it. When she/he clicks on the down arrow of the first input, it is possible to select the date in a calendar. There are also up and down arrows in the first and second input, to increase or decrease the numbers.
Finally, when the user clicks the button "check", the application should display a table showing which of the days are available and which are not, according to the data retrieved from the URL endpoint using JavaScript.
There is also information retrieved from the mentioned URL regarding the timezone, languages available, currency.

# Challenges
The biggest challenge I faced was to decide if I should use AJAX, or simple JavaScript to retrieve the data, and how much code I needed to write in order to display this data according to the starting date that the user would select.
I also noticed that even though the availabilies array inside of data array could display either 1 or 0 as characters inside of the string, it only displayed 0, no matter what starting date I included with the GET parameter. Because of that I believe the intention of this challenge was to check if I could write good and clean code to display the availability of rooms in hotels.
I liked to create this application, just wish I had more time to include more functionalities.
